## What is Docker?

The Apache‚Ñ¢ Hadoop¬Æ project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.
## What is a Docker Image?

Docker images are the basis of containers. Images are read-only, while containers are writeable. Only the containers can be executed by the operating system.

##  Objective :  

*  The purpose of docker-hadoop is to provide a full, standard, hadoop cluster that can be used for development or testing purposes.

Currently, it provides support for the following Hadoop distributions:
